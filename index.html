        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am Magdy Saleh, a Machine Learning engineer at <a href="gridspace.com">Gridspace</a>. Before that, I was an MSCS student at Stanford University focussing on AI/Biocomputation, with a particular interest in biomedical imaging. 
            At Stanford I have completed projects in computer vision for CT scans and NLP/NLU. Prior to the farm I was an undergraduate student at UCL, where I graduated with a BSc in Biomedical Engineering. During this time I was involved with the <a href="http://simonwalkersamuel.com/">Walker-Samuel Group</a>. <br> <br>
        
            If you want to get in touch with me, drop me a line at: <b>mksaleh at alumni dot standord dot edu</b>  <br> 

        This website is still a work in progress. </p>
